## Hi, I am Bjarn 👋
<p align="center">
<samp>I am a full stack developer with a broad experience in web and mobile development and DevOps. Born in The Netherlands in 1998 and haven't smoked weed since 🙌 . Besides developing awesome apps I am a huge 📻 radio nerd and working on a Dutch radiostation focussed on Gen Z called <a href="https://ztack.nl">ZTACK</a>.</samp>

### What I do.
A jack of all trades - yes, I am very 🔥 passionate about what I do. My primary focus is DevOps, Android and React development, but also am experienced with: 
- Android (Kotlin/Java)
- iOS (Swift)
- Vue/Nuxt
- React/Next
- PHP (Laravel, Magento 2)
- MySQL
- CSS (SASS/SCSS and CSS-in-JS w/ [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion))
- Git 🧐
- Go
- Python

For automation and other DevOps projects I am also familiar with software such as Ansible, Terraform, Openstack, Linux (mostly Debian & CentOS) and webhosting control panels like Plesk and DirectAdmin.

Since I work mostly on my own when it comes to my own projects, I also 👨‍🎨  design them myself using Figma.
